README

This is the repository for our unsupervised alias generation task.

We utilize pretrained language model(e.g. GPT2) to generate possible mentions for a word.

Here are the packages:

- demo
  - You can try out some examples here.

# Interesting Result

## Reproduction

Using the **same parameters** may get **different outputs:**(2021/10/29)
