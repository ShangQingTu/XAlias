This is the directory of human annotation.

We will evaluate the results generated by our model to identify aliases.

- It is very interesting that for `南京外国语学校`, our model generate the right alias `南外`, but it is not contained in the golden alias table.
- It is strange that for `揭岭`, its alias `贵人山` is missed.
- Some lower concepts always show up. For example, `碳钢结构钢` for `碳钢` and `喷气火箭发动机` for `喷气发动机`
